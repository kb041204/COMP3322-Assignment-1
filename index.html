			  To complete your placement record, please note that you <b style="color: #ff0000;">MUST</b> provide the following information:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Company Name</li>
                <li>Job Title/Position</li>

                  you have started working).</li>

              <p>The reasons to collect the information are:</p>
			  <ol>
			    <li>We need the information to justify whether this post satisfies
                the Internship requirements. Some of the posts may be advertised
                through us; however, we do not have the details of the job with us
                when we screened those positions and it is possible that the
                actual job duties are quite different from what have been
                advertised.</li>
				<li>For HKIE accreditation purpose - We are using this database
                for showing to HKIE during accreditation.</li>
			  </ol>
			  
              <p>You may find that the status of your placement record is either <b style="color: #ff0000;">NA / WAITING / INCOMPLETE / APPROVED</b>.
              The initial status of every placement record is in <span style="color: #ff0000;">NA</span>,
              i.e., it is an empty record. Once you have inputted info to the
              placement record, the system will change the status to <span style="color: #ff0000;">WAITING</span>.
              After you have done (or at least after adding the Job
              Description), press the "Submit" button to inform me, and I shall
              work on the screening. When you have entered sufficient
              information, with the document(s) to prove the internship, and the
              job satisfies the training requirements, I shall change the status
              of your placement record to <span style="color: #ff0000;">APPROVED</span>.
              If there are missing information, I shall change the status of
              your placement record to <span style="color: #ff0000;">INCOMPLETE</span>,
              for example, missing job description, missing supervisor's
              information, and missing appointment document. In addition, I
              shall enter my remark on the "Remark" field to let you know what I
              am expecting you to follow up with.</p>

              <p>Please note that to fulfill the Internship requirement, <b>it is
                important to register with the department once you have secured
                a placement</b>. <b style="color: #ff0000;">If we do not have a

			  <p><b>"Letter to supervisor"</b><br>
              As the supervisor's feedback report will contribute to the
              assessment of the course, we would like you to explicitly inform
              your supervisor of this requirement. To do so, we have designed a
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Consent Form"</span> for you to <b><u>give
                  it to the supervisor to complete it at the start of your

                  required to return the completed Consent Form to me once you
                  start</b> the placements. Here is the URL to download

              internship program is a component of the university degree
              curriculum. The govt. has prepared a standard form - "Confirmation
              of 'student intern' status under the Minimum Wage Ordinance (Cap.
              608)" - for this purpose.</p>

              <p>If the company requests you to provide them as the proof in order
