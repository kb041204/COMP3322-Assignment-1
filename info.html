	  <h2>Internship</h2>
	  <p>As an engineering student, you must gain working experience in
	  your field of study before you graduate. Such real-world
	  experience is an important and necessary complement to your
	  academic training. CSIS1412 / COMP3412 (Industrial Training /
	  Internship) embodies this and establishes it as a formal part of
	  your BEng(CompSc) programme.</p>
	  
      <p>To satisfy the degree requirement, you must spend <b>a minimum
	  of four weeks</b> in a full-time IT position. Most summer
	  internships actually span a longer period – 10 to 12 weeks is
	  common. During this period, you can expect:</p>
	  
      <ul>
		<li>to gain solid, practical experience related to your studies;</li>
		<li>to contribute your knowledge to the solution of real-world problems;</li>
		<li>to become familiar with the modern IT workplace;</li>
		<li>to acquire an appreciation of professional conduct and practice.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
      <p>This period of training brings many benefits. For example,
	  relevant working experience gives you a distinct advantage when
	  you seek employment as a fresh graduate. You can also make
	  valuable contacts for your future career. Employers often invite
	  their interns to continue working beyond the summer as part-time
	  staff. In many cases, this leads to the offer of a full-time
	  position upon graduation. More importantly, you can gain
	  first-hand experience of software development as it is actually
	  practised, and of the effect of real-world constraints such as
	  schedule, budget and available technology. This adds an
	  important dimension to your engineering education. These are
	  just a few of the benefits reported by students. In our
	  experience, students value these weeks spent working in their
	  field of expertise.</p>

	  <h3>Who must take CSIS1412 / COMP3412?</h3>
        <p>All students pursuing the BEng(CompSc) degree must pass
        CSIS1412 / COMP3412 as a requirement for graduation. This is
        true for both the single degree programme and the
        BBA(IS)/BEng(CS) double degree programme.</p>
	  </article>
	
	  <a id="Para2" class="in_page_anchor"></a>
	  <article class="second">
	  <h3>When must you take CSIS1412 / COMP3412?</h3>
		<p>To gain maximum benefit from Industrial Training, you must
        already possess a strong foundation of CS knowledge.
        Consequently, you may take CSIS1412 / COMP3412 only after
        completing the major part of your studies. Students in the
        3-year / 4-year programme may not take the course until they
        have completed their second / third year of studies. Students in
        the double degree BBA(IS)/BEng(CS) programme must wait until
        they have completed their BBA(IS) programme.</p>

      <article class="first">
	  <h3>How do you satisfy the Industrial Training requirement?</h3>
        <p>The Industrial Training requirement may be satisfied in one of
	    two ways: either by completing a summer industrial internship,
	    or by joining the Integrated Study-Work Programme and taking a
	    full-year sandwich internship.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Summer Industrial Internships</strong></p>
          <p>This is the most common way in which students satisfy the
		  requirement. If you choose this path you will spend 4 weeks to
		  3 months in full-time employment during the summer break. Most
		  students take internships located in or around Hong Kong.
		  This, however, is not a requirement and we encourage you to
		  apply for internships outside of the region.</p>
		  
          <p><strong>Sandwich (Study-Work) Internships </strong></p>
          <p>You may use a relevant part of your 12-14 month internship to
		  satisfy the Industrial Training requirement. You still must
		  deliver an Industrial Training report covering that specific
		  period (see below) and you will be assessed in the same way as
		  summer industrial interns. You can consult <a href="ISWP-new.html">this
          document</a> for more information on the IWSP.</p>

      <h3>What criteria must a job satisfy to qualify for CSIS1412 / COMP3412?</h3>
        <p>The job must be in the field of IT, preferably involving
		software development and working under the supervision of
		an experienced IT professional. You should not be the only IT
        person working in the company and, ideally, you will work as a
        member of a team. You must attend your employer's place of work
        and keep regular full-time hours. For the purposes of Internship, the sector (e.g. investment banking and finance,
        commerce, education, government, game development, etc.) is not
        important.</p>
		
        <p>As a rule of thumb, if the main focus of the job is something
        we teach in our CS courses, then the job will most likely be
        suitable for Industrial Training. On the other hand, if it is
        not something we teach, then it probably won't qualify. It is
        usually quite straightforward to determine whether or not a
        particular job can satisfy the Internship requirements.</p>
        
		<p>For example, the following do not satisfy the criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Computer sale</li>
            <li>Data entry</li>
            <li>Web page graphical designer</li>
            <li>Helpdesk support</li>
            <li>General office duties</li>
            <li>Part-time work</li>
            <li>Freelance work</li>
          </ul>
		  
        <p> If you are not sure about a particular internship, please
        contact the teacher-in-charge for advice.</p>

	  <h3>How to find an internship?</h3>
        <p>It is your responsibility to seek and secure a suitable
        internship. The University and the department provide a number
        of services to help you; most of our students find their
        industrial placement through one of these channels.</p>
        
		<ul>
          <li>One of the sources is our own internal Placement Database
          and summer Jobs newsgroup &lt;hku.cs.summerjob&gt;. Here we
          post opportunities that come to us directly from our contacts
          in industry. We also post internships forwarded by CEDARS,
          which require nominations from the department.</li>
		  <li>The best source is the careers service offered by the Centre
          of Development and Resources for Students (CEDARS). We work
          closely with CEDARS and they post and process many requests
          from companies seeking IT interns.</li>
          <li>You can find internships through the JIJIS system or, for
          internships on the mainland, the China Affairs Office (CAO).</li>
        </ul>
		
        <p>Recruitment activity reaches a peak during the months of April
        and May. Industrial sponsors will usually select interns on the
        strength of their resumes and interview performance. After
        accepting an internship, you will sign an agreement with the
        sponsor. We expect you to honour that agreement. Any problems
        encountered during training should be reported to the department
        before you take action; breaking an agreement without the
        department's prior approval will be treated as a serious breach
        of professional conduct.</p>

	  <h3>Tell us about your internship.</h3>
        <p>When you have secured a placement please let us know by
        updating your placement record in the Placement Database. Once
        you logged on to the Placement Database, you can find the "My
        Placement Record" button on the menu pane. We need to know who
        has a job and who hasn't. This is quite important – if we don't
        have a record of your placement you will fail CSIS1412 / COMP3412.</p>
        <p> Please note that you <strong>MUST</strong> provide the following information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Company Name</li>
            <li>Nature of work (job description)</li>
            <li>Start date and end date of the Internship</li>

            <li>Supervisor Name (you may send these later after you have started work)</li>
            <li>Supervisor Telephone and Email (you may send these later after you have started work)</li>
            <li>It is a paid / unpaid internship</li>

	  <h3>Reporting and Assessment</h3>
        <p>You are required to write a training report of approximately
        1000 words outlining the work you performed and providing a
        description and evaluation of the IT practices used by the
        organization. Independently, your supervisor/employer may report
        back to HKU on your professionalism and on the quality of your
        work. Assessment in CSIS1412 / COMP3412 is based on these two
        reports and is recorded as Pass or Fail.</p>
        
		<p>Suggested contents of your Industrial Training report are as
        follows (actual contents will vary depending on the nature of the internship):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a brief description of the organization and the department for which you worked;</li>
            <li>a description of your responsibilities during the internship;</li>
            <li>a description of the work performed and work products you delivered;</li>
            <li>a description and assessment of the technical substances (e.g., technologies, software development practices, etc.) used by the company; </li>
            <li>suggestions for improving those practices;</li>
            <li>an assessment of the value of the internship and of the experience gained.</li>
          </ul>
        
		<p>Please include the following information as the header of your report:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Student Name</li>
            <li>Student Number</li>
            <li>Company Name</li>

	  <h3>Collect Employer's/Supervisor's Feedback</h3>
        <p>Feedback is information about a student’s development. Students
        benefit from feedback when they understand the required
        standard; how their existing performance compares to this
        standard and; what they need to do to achieve a higher standard.
        Therefore, It is important for students to obtain feedback for
        their growth and development.</p>
        
		<p>The department has prepared a questionnaire for obtaining
        feedback from supervisor/employer. The feedback collected will
        contribute to the assessment of the course. It is important for
        students to inform their supervisors on this requirement.</p>
        
		<p>At the start of your internship, present the following "Consent
        Form" to your supervisor. All students are required to return
        the completed Consent Form to the Department's Internship
        Coordinator within the first two weeks of the placements.</p>
              
		<ul>
          <li><span style="color: #3333ff; font-weight: bold;">Download Consent Form</span> [ <a href="Form/Consent_Form_Employer.doc">Word</a> | <a href="Form/Consent_Form_Employer.pdf">PDF</a> ]</li>
        </ul>
        
		<p>On the last week of your internship, present the following
        "Feedback Form" to your supervisor. Invite them to return the
        completed form within two weeks after the internship.</p>
